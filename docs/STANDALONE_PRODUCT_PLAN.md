# GodForge Standalone Product Plan

Status: proposed implementation plan  
Last updated: July 20, 2026

## Product direction

GodForge should become the SMITE 2 custom-night operating system for Discord:

> Form a ten-player lobby, confirm that everyone is ready, create fair
> role-complete teams, run a fearless draft, record the game-night outcome,
> and keep the group playing.

The core loop is:

```text
party formation
  -> ready check
  -> role-complete teams
  -> fearless draft
  -> result confirmation and history
  -> rematch or re-queue
```

GodForge must be a complete standalone product. ForgeLens is not part of the
required user journey. Its existing export and integration code should remain
available behind an optional, disabled-by-default adapter in case the companion
product returns, but GodForge workflows must work identically when ForgeLens is
absent.

## Product boundary

GodForge owns:

- Party formation and lobby discovery.
- Ready checks, waitlists, and substitute promotion.
- SMITE role preferences and role-complete team formation.
- Captains, team rooms, and fearless drafts.
- Game-night match state.
- Lightweight result confirmation and match history.
- Optional aggregate game-night statistics.
- Rematches, team shuffles, and re-queueing.

GodForge does not currently own:

- Economy, wallets, wagering, odds, payouts, or betting.
- Official SMITE ranks.
- Automated OCR or detailed per-player performance ingestion.
- A global player reputation score.
- A tournament bracket engine.
- Cross-server matchmaking before the single-server product proves demand.

ForgeLens compatibility is a failsafe integration surface only. No ForgeLens
failure may block lobby creation, drafting, result confirmation, history, or
rematches.

## Why this direction

Comparable Discord products validate several expectations:

- Modern LFG flows use buttons, forms, and browsable lobby cards rather than
  requiring users to memorize commands.
- Temporary text and voice rooms with automatic cleanup are table stakes.
- Ready checks, capacity limits, waitlists, and substitute promotion prevent
  no-shows from collapsing an event.
- MOBA communities need role-complete and reasonably fair teams, not only
  random splitting.
- Planned events and immediate LFG increasingly converge on the same live lobby
  workflow.
- Generic products usually stop at attendance or group formation. GodForge can
  differentiate by continuing through SMITE-specific drafting, results, and
  rematches.

The moat is not the number of bot commands. It is the shortest, most reliable
path from ten interested SMITE 2 players to a completed, recorded custom match.

## Target users

### Community PUG organizer

Turn ten interested members into two valid teams and begin drafting without
spreadsheets, repeated pings, or manually moving people.

### League or scrim administrator

Confirm both rosters, handle substitutes, enforce series rules, and preserve a
clean draft and result record.

### Player

Set role preferences once, join in one click, know when the lobby is ready, and
play again with people from a good match.

### Server administrator

Configure channels, roles, defaults, and permissions safely without editing
environment variables or JSON.

## Delivery phases

### Phase 0: production foundation

Complete this before promoting GodForge to unrelated servers.

#### Durable guild and orchestration state

- Persist guild settings, party lobbies, participants, role preferences, ready
  states, drafts, and match linkage.
- Recover live operations after restart and reconcile missing Discord
  messages/channels.
- Make state transitions idempotent and auditable.
- Use one production database-backed repository abstraction. Keep JSON only for
  local development or explicit import/export.

#### Guild authorization and setup

- Complete Discord OAuth guild permission verification.
- Require Manage Guild or a configured organizer role for administration.
- Detect whether GodForge is installed and provide the correct invite flow.
- Configure the lobby panel channel, temporary-room category,
  organizer/captain roles, region, and default rules.

#### Scope cleanup

- Remove legacy betting, wallet, ledger, and economy panels from the active
  GodForge experience.
- Replace economy-oriented match operations with a small match lifecycle:
  scheduled, lobby open, ready, drafting, playing, result pending, complete,
  or cancelled.
- Preserve ForgeLens code only as an isolated optional adapter with compatibility
  tests.
- Hide ForgeLens identifiers and status from normal workflows when disabled.

Exit criteria:

- A restart does not silently lose an active lobby or draft.
- OAuth login alone cannot grant guild administration.
- A fresh server can install and configure GodForge without source edits.

### Phase 1: Party Lobby MVP

This is the highest-priority market feature.

#### Persistent Play SMITE panel

An administrator runs `/party setup` once. GodForge posts a durable panel with:

- Create lobby.
- Browse lobbies.
- Join queue.
- My preferences.

The panel survives individual lobby cleanup and can be refreshed without
duplication.

#### Lobby creation and discovery

Use a Discord modal to capture:

- Mode, beginning with Conquest.
- Play now or scheduled.
- Region.
- Format: casual custom, balanced PUG, captains draft, or pre-made scrim.
- Party size, defaulting to ten.
- Optional experience or skill band.
- Voice requirement.
- Notes.

The lobby card shows open spots, waitlist, start time, organizer, and rules.
Buttons provide Join, Leave, Edit, Cancel, and Share.

#### Role preferences

Collect a player's:

- First-choice role.
- Second-choice role.
- Fill permission.
- Captain volunteer preference.

Store preferences per guild and allow players to revise them in the lobby.
Do not require a separate web account.

#### Capacity, waitlist, and substitutes

- Fill the active roster before an ordered waitlist.
- Promote a compatible substitute when someone leaves or fails ready check.
- Prefer promotions that preserve Jungle, Mid, ADC, Support, and Solo coverage.
- Notify affected users without repeated server-wide pings.

#### Ready check

- Start automatically at capacity or manually by the organizer.
- Provide Ready, Need 5 Minutes, and Drop actions.
- Apply a configurable timeout.
- Move timed-out players to the waitlist or remove them.
- Reveal private lobby credentials only after required players are ready.

#### Temporary rooms

- Create a lobby thread/text room and optional team voice rooms.
- Give the organizer limited lock, kick, transfer, and close controls.
- Clean up empty rooms after a grace period.
- Archive a lobby summary before deletion.

#### Draft transition

When ready:

- Form or confirm teams.
- Select captains.
- Start the existing GodForge draft without re-entering participants and
  options.
- Preserve the lobby, guild, participants, roles, rules, and GodForge match ID
  in the draft and match record.

Phase 1 non-goals:

- Cross-server queues.
- AI personality matching.
- Public reputation scores.
- Automated brackets.
- In-game rank verification.

### Phase 2: match quality and retention

#### Role-aware team formation

Support:

1. Role fit: maximize first- and second-choice satisfaction.
2. Balanced: minimize the team-strength difference while filling all roles.
3. Captains: draft players with role visibility.

Begin with transparent GodForge-owned inputs: organizer skill bands, optional
self-declared experience, role preference, and recent game-night history.
Explain the balance outcome instead of presenting an opaque AI score.

#### Standalone results and history

- Let both captains confirm the winner.
- Let an organizer resolve disagreement.
- Support cancelled and no-contest outcomes.
- Store teams, roles, draft reference, result, series score, timestamps, and
  participants.
- Show recent matches for a guild, team, or player.
- Provide recreational aggregate statistics such as appearances, wins, role
  frequency, teammate frequency, and streaks.
- Clearly scope these statistics to GodForge-run games.

Detailed performance statistics, OCR, screenshots, and automated ingestion are
optional future work. Economy and betting remain excluded.

#### Rematch and stay together

After completion, offer:

- Run it back with the same teams.
- Shuffle teams.
- Return to queue.
- Invite substitutes.
- Continue a best-of series.

#### Lightweight safety

- Private block/avoid lists.
- Organizer reporting with categories and evidence links.
- Per-guild notes and suspensions.
- Opt-in favorite teammate and recently played signals.

Do not launch a public global reputation number without formal moderation,
appeal, and privacy systems.

### Phase 3: scheduled nights and scrims

#### Scheduled sessions

- Natural-language time input with explicit timezone confirmation.
- Weekly templates.
- Capacity, role slots, waitlists, and reminders.
- Calendar export.
- Convert RSVPs into a live check-in lobby before the start.

Every scheduled event must end in a party, scrim, or draft workflow. GodForge
should not become a general calendar.

#### Teams and scrim challenges

- Guild-scoped teams with captain, roster, substitutes, region, and preferred
  time.
- Challenge, accept, reject, or propose a new time.
- Lock and check in rosters.
- Create private match rooms and launch the existing series/draft workflow.

#### Tournament integration

Integrate with an established bracket provider before building bracket logic:

- Import or link scheduled tournament matches.
- Map checked-in rosters to GodForge lobbies.
- Export GodForge match and draft references.

### Phase 4: network effects

Only after the single-server product has proven demand:

- Let guilds opt into a trusted cross-server lobby network.
- Share only region, mode, time, skill band, and open spots until a join is
  accepted.
- Preserve each guild's bans and safety policy.
- Rate-limit broadcasts and provide granular administrator controls.

Launch only after at least 20 active guilds, healthy local fill and completion
rates, and documented moderation, appeal, privacy, and retention policies.

## Implementation sequence

Each tracker issue should be a thin, independently verifiable vertical slice.

1. Establish the party-lobby domain model, durable state, and recovery path.
2. Complete permission-safe guild setup and publish a persistent Play panel.
3. Deliver create, browse, join, leave, and preference flows.
4. Add capacity, waitlist, compatible substitute promotion, and ready checks.
5. Create and reconcile temporary party/team rooms.
6. Convert a ready lobby into the existing fearless draft.
7. Add standalone result confirmation and match history.
8. Add role-aware balance and captains-based player drafting.
9. Add rematch, shuffle, substitute, and re-queue actions.
10. Add scheduled sessions that convert into live lobbies.
11. Add team rosters and scrim challenges.
12. Isolate and feature-gate the optional ForgeLens adapter.

New Discord interactions should be extracted from the already-large `bot.py`.
Use a Discord adapter/cog layer over pure party, balancing, and match services.
Model lobby transitions explicitly:

```text
open -> full -> ready_check -> forming -> active -> completed
                                                \-> cancelled
                                                \-> expired
```

Discord message and channel IDs are delivery references, not domain identity.
Use reconciliation or outbox behavior for Discord side effects so retries and
restarts do not duplicate rooms or drafts.

## Success metrics

### Activation

- At least 60% of configured guilds create a lobby within 24 hours.
- Median setup time below five minutes.

### Party formation

- Median immediate lobby creation-to-ready time below 15 minutes in active
  communities.
- At least 70% of full lobbies become an active draft.
- Fewer than 15% of reserved seats become ready-check no-shows.

### Completion and retention

- At least 90% of started drafts reach a confirmed result or an explicit
  cancelled/no-contest state.
- At least 25% of completed lobbies choose rematch, shuffle, or re-queue.

### Reliability

- No silent loss of active lobby state during a routine restart.
- Fewer than 1% of lobbies require manual orphan cleanup.

Do not begin cross-server discovery until GodForge sustains 20 weekly active
guilds, 100 completed monthly lobbies, a four-week completion rate above 70%,
and a documented safety and appeal process.

## Optional ForgeLens compatibility policy

- Disabled by default.
- No required service, environment variable, identifier, or UI state.
- No ForgeLens failure can block a core GodForge workflow.
- Preserve compatibility tests for the portable draft JSON.
- Keep companion-specific fields out of core party, draft, and match models.
- Map core records to ForgeLens payloads only inside the adapter.
- If reactivated, begin with optional advanced statistics or historical
  enrichment.
- Do not reactivate wallets, wagering, odds, payouts, or betting as part of the
  integration.
