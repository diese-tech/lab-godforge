"""Temporary-room reconciliation and cleanup as a shared lifecycle hook.

Feature module for the Issue #48 refactor. Wraps the per-guild temporary-room
reconciliation (on startup) and cleanup (periodically) that previously lived as
inline loops in ``bot.py``'s ``on_ready`` and cleanup task, registering them
through the shared ``FeatureRegistry`` instead.

Domain logic stays in ``utils/match_rooms.py``; this module only sequences
per-guild service calls using the injected match-room repository, room-service
factory, and party repository (needed to check whether a lobby has reached a
terminal state before closing its rooms).
