"""The `/party room` organizer-controls subcommand: Discord adapter.

Feature module for the Issue #48 refactor. Owns the `room` subcommand
(lock/unlock/remove/transfer/move/close), previously defined directly in
``bot.py``. Domain logic stays in ``utils/match_rooms.py``; this module routes
one Discord command to the appropriate ``MatchRoomService`` call.

Registered onto the existing `/party` command group via
``register_party_room_command``, mirroring the schedule-commands pattern.
